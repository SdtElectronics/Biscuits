## [BBSink](./BBSink/README.md)
USB-PD sink with headers compatible with breadboard. Features a fixed 3.3V supply and one-click voltage selection without incorporating MCUs

## [LCD_Bias_Voltage_Generator](./LCD_Bias_Voltage_Generator/README.md)
Except a 3.3V `DVDD`, LCD panels typically require 4 additional voltages: `AVDD`, `VGH`, `VGL` and `VCOM`. This board employs a simple circuit to generate these 4 voltages from a single 3.3V supply.

## [PCA9685_Breakout](./PCA9685_Breakout/README.md)
Breakout board for PCA9685 IÂ²C to 16-channel PWM controller.

## [BLDC_D28_Drv](./BLDC_D28_Drv/README.md)
Tiny driver stage for mounting on BLDC motors with 28/29mm diameters.

## [CH224Core](./CH224Core/README.md)
Tiny breakout board for CH224K USB-PD sink IC.

## [XPT2046_RTP](./XPT2046_RTP/README.md)
Breakout board for XPT2046 resistive touch screen controller.

## 50P_FPC_FFC_Breakout
Breakout board for FFC/FPC connectors with 50 positions and 0.5mm pitch.

## 24P_FPC_FFC_Breakout
Breakout board for FFC/FPC connectors with 24 positions and 0.5mm pitch.

## 14P_FPC_FFC_Breakout
