## [LCD_Bias_Voltage_Generator](./LCD_Bias_Voltage_Generator/README.md)
Except a 3.3V `DVDD`, LCD panels typically require 4 additional voltages: `AVDD`, `VGH`, `VGL` and `VCOM`. This board employs a simple circuit to generate these 4 voltages from a single 3.3V supply.

## [BLDC_D28_Drv](./BLDC_D28_Drv/README.md)
Tiny driver stage for mounting on BLDC motors with 28/29mm diameters.

## [XPT2046_RTP](./XPT2046_RTP/README.md)
Breakout board for XPT2046 resistive touch screen controller.

## 50P_FPC_FFC_Breakout
Breakout board for FFC/FPC connectors with 50 positions and 0.5mm pitch.

## 14P_FPC_FFC_Breakout
Breakout board for FFC/FPC connectors with 14 positions and 0.5mm pitch.
